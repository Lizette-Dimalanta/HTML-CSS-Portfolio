<!------------------------------- PROFESSIONAL DESCRIPTION --------------------------------->
<main>
    <h2>In a nutshell.</h2>
    <section class="prof-description">
        <p>Originally growing up on the Gold Coast, most available jobs for young adults were hospitality or retail. Because of this, most of my professional experience were heavily revolved around customer service and team management. Previously, I was an acting manager for Coles Supermarkets and supported isolated team members during the COVID-19 lockdown period. After years of progressing in my role, I decided that there was not much left for me to learn in the field. I put my Diploma of Business to use and moved into an admin role at a tech startup - this is where everything changed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Despite my passion for technology, I had grown up with the assumption that working in a tech industry was not a suitable role for a woman. However, over the next 7 months, I was introduced to all the possibilities of the tech sector. I worked amongst a small yet incredibly supportive team of software developers and a UX/UI designer. My curiosity led me to exploring the fundamentals of design, marketing and software development.</p>

    <h2>My Aspirations</h2>
    <section class="prof-description">
        <p>With determination to break into the tech industry, I am currently studying at the <em>Coder Academy Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.</em> I aspire to share my ideas and perspectives through my passion for code, and to encourage women and those from low-income backgrounds that you can still pursue your passion from the ground up.</p>
